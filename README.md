Program that outputs information about Windows network adapters in a tabular format with an option to select output format â€” CSV or JSON.

Data for each network adapter includes:

- Adapter Name
- MAC Address
- IP Addresses (all assigned)
- Current Adapter State (up/down)
- DHCP Enabled
- DNS Servers
- Gateway
- Data Sources (registry keys from which parameters were retrieved)

Most network parameters are obtained from the Windows system registry. Each adapter's data is located in a separate registry key, the path of which is constructed using the adapter's GUID.

Main adapter registry path:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\**<Adapter GUID>**
```
Here, `**<Adapter GUID>**` is the unique adapter identifier, which can be normalized by removing the `\DEVICE\TCPIP_` prefix if present.

Values extracted from this key:
- `IPAddress` (REG_MULTI_SZ or REG_SZ):  
  Contains one or more IP addresses assigned to the adapter. If missing, it may be empty.
- `DhcpIPAddress` (REG_SZ):  
  The DHCP-assigned IP address. If DHCP is not used or no IP is assigned, this may be absent.
- `NameServer` (REG_SZ):  
  DNS servers manually configured on the adapter.
- `DhcpNameServer` (REG_SZ):  
  DNS servers obtained via DHCP.

Selection logic:
- If `IPAddress` is missing or empty, use `DhcpIPAddress`.
- Presence of `DhcpIPAddress` indicates DHCP is enabled.
- DNS servers are taken from `NameServer` first; if empty, from `DhcpNameServer`.

The program also annotates output with the source of each parameter, indicating the full registry path (e.g., `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\<GUID>\IPAddress`).  
If registry retrieval fails, alternative methods (WinAPI) are used.

**Installation**
1. Download all source files and open the project in Code::Blocks (project configured for Code::Blocks 20.03).
2. Download json.hpp module from https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp and add it into project folder.
3. Click *Build and Run* in Code::Blocks.  
   The resulting `.exe` will appear in the `bin` directory.  
   It can also be run via Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Alternatively, build the project manually:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o network_info.exe New.cpp -liphlpapi -lws2_32
```

**Using the compiled .exe**
Default run:
```
network_info.exe
```
Outputs results in CSV format. Example:
```csv

"Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1","","::1, 127.0.0.1","Up","No","",""
```

You can also add the `--json` argument to output in JSON format:
```
.
etwork_info.exe --json
```
Example JSON output:
```json
